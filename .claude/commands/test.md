# Run ValetFlow Tests

Execute the test suite for the ValetFlow project.

**Scheme:** ValetFlow
**Configuration:** Debug
**Destination:** iOS Simulator (any available)

## Steps

1. Check if test targets exist in the project
2. Select an appropriate simulator for testing
3. Boot the simulator if needed
4. Run all tests in the ValetFlow scheme
5. Report test results with:
   - Total tests run
   - Passed tests
   - Failed tests (with failure details)
   - Test execution time
6. If tests fail, provide detailed failure information and suggest fixes

## Success Criteria

- All tests pass
- No test crashes or timeouts
- Test coverage meets expectations

## Notes

- Tests run on a clean simulator state
- Performance tests may take longer
- UI tests require simulator to be fully booted
